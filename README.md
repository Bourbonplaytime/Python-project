# Python-project
Analyzing crime data 

This project is designed to break down crime by type within given zips in Louisville, Ky. It requires several python packages to run including pandas, csv, sqlite3, matplotlib, and numpy as well as Jupyter Notebooks. It was written as a project for a program known as Code Louisville designed to provide technical training for students within the city. It incorporates python and sqlite3 to pull data from a csv obtained from Louisville Metro government and manipulate it in a variety of ways to create a series of pie and bar charts which indicate crime by type within a selection of zips 40216, 40217, and 40245.
